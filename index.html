      <h2>About me</h2>

      I’m currently a student at WeThinkCode_, where I’m being trained to become
      a professional software developer. My training emphasizes critical
      thinking and crafting innovative technological solutions. Throughout my
      journey, I’ve gained a solid foundation in programming, starting with
      Python and advancing to object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. I’ve
      worked on individual and group projects that involved integrating APIs,
      utilizing databases with Java Persistence and ORM, and building web APIs.
      I’ve also acquired experience with tools such as Git, IntelliJ, Visual
      Studio Code, Docker, and GitLab CI/CD. Additionally, I am well-versed in
      agile development methodologies and use Test-Driven Development (TDD) and
      acceptance testing to ensure quality in my projects. <br /><br />

      As part of the
      <a href="https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/87343-singabenkosi-mpungose"
      target="_blank"  
      >SheCodes</a
      >
      community, I’ve sharpened my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through
      online workshops, and I’ve learned how to host projects using Netlify.
      Alongside my technical training, I hold a Bachelor of Accounting degree
      from the University of Johannesburg. <br /><br />
      I am passionate about creating scalable and maintainable software
      solutions and thrive on simplifying complex problems with clean, efficient
      code. I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and continuous
      learning to deliver high-quality projects. <br />
      Recently, I was honored with a medallion for ranking 9th position in
      Semester 2 across all WeThinkCode_ campuses. Outside of coding, I enjoy
      reading, which helps me unwind. Lately I’ve grown an interest in tech
      books, especially since I did not get into tech through the traditional
      route.
